# Kubernetes ConfigMap object

[Kubernetes Documentation/Concepts/Configuration/ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)

> A **ConfigMap** is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume. It allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable.

[Kubernetes Documentation/Concepts/Storage/Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)

A **PersistentVolume** is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource.
